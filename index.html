            <h2>Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text2">
                An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience that can be bold and risky, with an uncertain outcome. Some examples of adventure activities include: exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, and extreme sports.
                <br><br>
                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”

            <p class="text2">
                Bicycles have become even more important in recent times. While they have been offering us many advantages for a long time, they are very vital now. It is because of the rate at which pollution is growing in the world, they offer a greener way to commute.
                <br><br>
                In other words, bicycles do not require any petrol or diesel which harms our atmosphere. Further, it does not leave a carbon footprint as well. Thus, it is a great choice for everyone especially those who are environment-friendly.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text2">
                It’s easy to talk about a surf session, a break, a particular wave, or a board with other surfers, but writing about surfing is very hard.  It’s like trying to paint a picture of wind or describe love.  There are things that, when you wrap them in a blanket of words, they stop being what they are.  I can describe to you a picture of surfing, but how can I tell you what surfing is like?  It is motion.  It is pain and delight and infinite patience.  It is “stop” perfectly braided with “go.”
                <br><br>
                Surfing begins in the sky, with heavenly bodies—the sun, the moon, maybe even the stars.  The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon pull on Earth’s water, making bulges the planet spins through.  And then there are the storms.  Warm and cold air swirl in the sky.  Storms form over the ocean and, like kiddos jumping on the bed, cause the surface to bounce up and down.

            </div>
            <p class="text2">
                Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.
                <br><br>
                First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. The paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off and landing.
